#Desert Bus Auction Notifier

Want to give [Desert Bus](http://desertbus.org "Desert Bus") more of your money to the children but forget to look at the schedule?  
Missing out on all the awesome live auctions because you were reading Redit or Emails or that whole "job" thing?  
Have trouble reading chat because seriously, chat is insane?  
Well, worry no longer, for the Desert Bus Auction Notifier is here to solve that!

##Features

The Desert Bus Auction Notifier is a Google Chrome extension that will give you a Google Chrome Notification when
the current status of live auctions changes.  

![Alert View](/screenshots/alertView.png "Alert View")

The following trigger an alert to your screen:

- New High Price (Also Indicates Auction Start)
- Going Once
- Going Twice
- SOLD

In addition, the notifications have a button to get you straight to Desert Bus's Twitch channel, removing that whole "typing in the web address"
thing out of the equation.

Notifications are also stored in the Chrome Notification Center so you can check previous alerts there to make sure you did not miss anything and/or
learn the name of that jerk who sniped you at the last second.

##Data

All data is generated by an API designed to monitor Desert Bus Live Auctions through Chat.
The endpoint can be found at [http://dbauction.herokuapp.com/status](http://dbauction.herokuapp.com/status "Auction Status").

The following information is returned by this JSON API:

```
{
	inAuction: false,		// Is there an auction currently going (boolean)
	goingOnce: false,		// Is the auction in "Going Once" (boolean)
	goingTwice: false,		// Is the auction in "Going Twice" (boolean)
	sold: true,				// Is the auction in "Sold" (boolean)
	price: "$10000.00",		// The current price in USD (string)
	highBidder: "Notch",	// The bidder with the current highest bid (string)
	prize: "Silica Gel"		// The name of the current auction according to BidBot (string)
}
```

All data is based on what BidBot says in chat, so data might get weird if they keep accidentally triggering auctions.
